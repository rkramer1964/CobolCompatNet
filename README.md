# CobolCompatNet
Grab bag of things to work with cobol data more easily from c#

# Why Oh Why???

I find myself working on mainframe transition projects a lot.  Data from COBOL a lot. Remapping data a lot.
And moving from the old formats isn't easy in c#.  It's tedious, error prone.

I've started collecting my grab bag of things I do over and over here.  No real rhyme or reason, just a bunch
of utility stuff that I hope to post over time in the hope someone finds it useful.
